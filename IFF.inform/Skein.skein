Male Sleeping Quarters
This is the male sleeping quarters for this expidition. The walls are covered in movie posters and there are odds and ends, dishes and cups strewn everywhere. Somewhere in this dump there are records of the history-altering discoveries this expidition has made. To the southeast is the common room.

You can see an Alarm Clock, a Wardrobe (closed) and a Backpack (closed) here.

Sleeping quarters for the women on this expedition. It&apos;s rather rude of you to go snooping around people&apos;s personal spaces when they&apos;re not around, you know. Tsk. Don&apos;t expect to get invited to my house anytime soon. The room is far from tidy, but it seems impeccable compared to the rest of this outpost. There is a first-aid kit atop the side table, and a dresser in the far corner of the room. An Elvish Sword is mounted above one of the beds

You can see a first aid kit (in which are a tampon, a bandage and a granola bar), a Dresser (closed) and an Elvish Sword here.
