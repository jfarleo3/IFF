An Interactive Fiction by Joseph Farleo, Andrew Slembarski, and Sydney Young
Release 1 / Serial number 150414 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Male Sleeping Quarters
This is the male sleeping quarters for this expedition. The walls are covered in movie posters and there are odds and ends, dishes and cups strewn everywhere. Somewhere in this dump there are records of the history-altering discoveries this expedition has made. To the southeast is the common room.

You can see an Alarm Clock, a Wardrobe (closed) and a Backpack (closed) here.

Common Room
Home sweet home for the rest of the expedition. There is a small kitchen area in the corner. All kinds of lab equipment is strewn across the lab table in the middle of the room, scientific research abandoned each morning to persue scientific FIELD research. You are not a scientist and do not understand what the other members of the expidition are doing when they peer at the artefacts they&apos;ve uncovered and make sounds like &apos;hmm&apos; and &apos;fascinating&apos;.
 To the north is the bathroom. The male bedrooms are to the northwest, and the female bedrooms are to the southwest. The door to the east leads outside.

You can see Base Door, Kitchen Table (on which is a sack lunch (closed)), a Lab Table (on which are a microscope, a preserved thoracic sac, an EDP (in which are a Chapter 1 and a Chapter 2) and a laser scalpel) and a bathroom door here.

Kind of nippy out here.

Dig Site (on the Snowmobile)
There is a huge crater where a series of expiditions have unearthed layers upon layers of ancient species that have rizen in the thawed cycles of this water moon and fallen during the freezing cycles. The moon is a scientific marvel, where new species rise and fall in a cycle of evolution and mass extinction. The crater is surrounded by a lattice of drilling rigs and decends through strata that encompass entire lifetimes of civilizations. To the north is the elevator that leads down the hole. You can see a ladder leading up to the drilling rig. In the distance to the east, you can barely see the outline of the garage door

An Interactive Fiction by Joseph Farleo, Andrew Slembarski, and Sydney Young
Release 1 / Serial number 150413 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Male Sleeping Quarters
This is the male sleeping quarters for this expidition. The walls are covered in movie posters and there are odds and ends, dishes and cups strewn everywhere. Somewhere in this dump there are records of the history-altering discoveries this expidition has made. To the southeast is the common room.

You can see an Alarm Clock, a Wardrobe (closed) and a Backpack (closed) here.

Common Room
Home sweet home for the rest of the expedition. There is a small kitchen area in the corner. All kinds of lab equipment is strewn across the lab table in the middle of the room, scientific research abandoned each morning to persue scientific FIELD research. You are not a scientist and do not understand what the other members of the expidition are doing when they peer at the artefacts they&apos;ve uncovered and make sounds like &apos;hmm&apos; and &apos;fascinating&apos;.
 To the north is the bathroom. The male bedrooms are to the northwest, and the female bedrooms are to the southwest. The door to the east leads outside.

You can see Base Door, Kitchen Table (on which is a sack lunch (closed)), a Lab Table (on which are a microscope, a preserved thoracic sac, an EDP (in which are a Chapter 1 and a Chapter 2) and a laser scalpel) and a bathroom door here.

Dig Site (on the Snowmobile)
There is a huge crater where a series of expiditions have unearthed layers upon layers of ancient species that have rizen in the thawed cycles of this water moon and fallen during the freezing cycles. The moon is a scientific marvel, where new species rise and fall in a cycle of evolution and mass extinction. The crater is surrounded by a lattice of drilling rigs and decends through strata that encompass entire lifetimes of civilizations. To the north is the elevator that leads down the hole. You can see a ladder leading up to the drilling rig. In the distance to the east, you can barely see the outline of the garage door

Dim Cavern
This level is significantly darker than the layer above. You are now deep in the ice caves, where very little research has been done. Light glistens off of the walls and cieling of the chamber, casting eeire shadows that obscuree the vague, yet menacing somethings frozen in the walls of the chamber. Your eyes drift across the dancing shadows on the ice until they reach the far wall of the chamber and meet another, much, much larger eye. It seems fixated on you though, frozen solid in ice, it cannot move. In the ice beyond, you see the shilouette of some hideous monster, bigger than any thing you thought could live. Jenkies. You feel the sudden urge to to be very very quiet. There is a patch of thin ice covering the west bottom quarter of an expanse of the chamber some ways down. To the east there seems to be the nose of some bizarre ship protruding from the ice, the rest of it frozen into the floor of the ice cave.

You can see Patch of thin ice here.

Dig Site
There is a huge crater where a series of expiditions have unearthed layers upon layers of ancient species that have rizen in the thawed cycles of this water moon and fallen during the freezing cycles. The moon is a scientific marvel, where new species rise and fall in a cycle of evolution and mass extinction. The crater is surrounded by a lattice of drilling rigs and decends through strata that encompass entire lifetimes of civilizations. To the north is the elevator that leads down the hole. You can see a ladder leading up to the drilling rig. In the distance to the east, you can barely see the outline of the garage door

Dig Site (on the Snowmobile)
There is a huge crater where a series of expeditions have unearthed layers upon layers of ancient species that have risen in the thawed cycles of this water moon and fallen during the freezing cycles. The moon is a scientific marvel, where new species rise and fall in a cycle of evolution and mass extinction. The crater is surrounded by a lattice of drilling rigs and descends through strata that encompass entire lifetimes of civilizations. To the north is the elevator that leads down the hole. You can see a ladder leading up to the drilling rig. In the distance to the east, you can barely see the outline of the garage door

You can see ladder and a Garage Door here.

Female Sleeping Quarters
Sleeping quarters for the women on this expedition. It&apos;s rather rude of you to go snooping around people&apos;s personal spaces when they&apos;re not around, you know. Tsk. Don&apos;t expect to get invited to my house anytime soon. The room is far from tidy, but it seems impeccable compared to the rest of this outpost. There is a first-aid kit atop the side table, and a dresser in the far corner of the room. An Elvish Sword is mounted above one of the beds
