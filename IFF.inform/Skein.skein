    <result xml:space="preserve">The year is 11057. It has been a few days since you and your crewmates have been dispatched onto the ice planet of Glacis for research purposes. Ever since the expansion in the planetary exploration budget, your home planet naturally sent the finest biologists, zoologists, archeologists, and other various -ologists that could potentially aid the cause of furthering scientific knowledge. &#x000A;&#x000A;And, somehow, you, lucky little intern, won the application lottery and managed to get on the team after writing one of the finest essays that your tiny little Geology undergrad-student mind could churn up. &#x000A;&#x000A;Congratulations. &#x000A;&#x000A;Besides the lack of rocks on the expedition, much to your dismay might I add, you seem to enjoy the experience of digging through the thick ice with a massive laser drill and creating an elevator just east of the base, observing the Phosphorescent Space Penguins, not too far north, and exploring the first floor of the caves underneath the surface with the rest of the crew. The team is a fairly nice bunch and you have quickly learned most of their quirks and abits of the individuals you are with. &#x000A;&#x000A; One of those 'quirks' is that the group has a collective problem of assuming that everyone knows where the group will be heading that day without leaving any significant reminders for stragglers. And if one were to sleep in, it is up to him or her to track down the group and get to work before anyone realizes that that person was missing or that person would get quite the lecture from Marcus. &#x000A;&#x000A;You are not the first to make the blunder of sleeping in, yet here you are. &#x000A;&#x000A;The group has already gone to the dig site without you. You had better hurry there or you will likely face Marcus's wrath.&#x000A;&#x000A;Fantastic Jurassic Antarctic Cthulhu Adventure&#x000A;An Interactive Fiction by Joseph Farleo, Andrew Slembarski, and Sydney Young&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 150414 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Male Sleeping Quarters&#x000A;This is the male sleeping quarters for this expedition. The walls are covered in movie posters and there are odds and ends, dishes and cups strewn everywhere. Somewhere in this dump there are records of the history-altering discoveries this expedition has made. To the southeast is the common room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an Alarm Clock, a Wardrobe (closed) and a Backpack (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's rather rude of you to go snooping around people's personal spaces when they're not around, you know. Tsk. Don't expect to get invited to my house anytime soon. The room is far from tidy, but it seems impeccable compared to the rest of this outpost. There is a first-aid kit atop the side table, and a dresser in the far corner of the room.

The crater is surrounded by a lattice of drilling rigs and decends through strata that encompass entire lifetimes of civilizations. To the north is the elevator that leads down the hole. You can see a ladder leading up to the drilling rig. In the distance to the east, you can barely see the outline of the garage door&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Garage Door, Elevator Door, ladder and a Snowmobile here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">&#x000A;Dim Cavern&#x000A;This level is significantly darker than the layer above. You are now deep in the ice caves, where very little research has been done. Light glistens off of the walls and cieling of the chamber, casting eeire shadows that obscuree the vague, yet menacing somethings frozen in the walls of the chamber. Your eyes drift across the dancing shadows on the ice until they reach the far wall of the chamber and meet another, much, much larger eye. It seems fixated on you though, frozen solid in ice, it cannot move. In the ice beyond, you see the shilouette of some hideous monster, bigger than any thing you thought could live. Jenkies. You feel the sudden urge to to be very very quiet. There is a patch of thin ice covering the west bottom quarter of an expanse of the chamber some ways down. To the east there seems to be the nose of some bizarre ship protruding from the ice, the rest of it frozen into the floor of the ice cave.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see Portable Laser Jackhammer (Charged) and Patch of thin ice here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
