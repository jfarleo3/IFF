Male Sleeping Quarters
This is the male sleeping quarters for this expidition. The walls are covered in movie posters and there are odds and ends, dishes and cups strewn everywhere. Somewhere in this dump there are records of the history-altering discoveries this expidition has made. To the southeast is the common room.

You can see an Alarm Clock, a Wardrobe (closed) and a Backpack (closed) here.

Home sweet home for the rest of the expedition. There is a small kitchen area in the corner. All kinds of lab equipment is strewn across the lab tables in the middle of the room, scientific research abandoned each morning to persue scientific FIELD research. You are not a scientist and do not understand what the other members of the expidition are doing when they peer at the artefacts they&apos;ve uncovered and make sounds like &apos;hmm&apos; and &apos;fascinating&apos;.
 To the north is the bathroom. The male bedrooms are to the northwest, and the female bedrooms are to the southwest. The door to the east leads outside.

You can see Base Door, Kitchen Table (on which is a sack lunch (closed)), a Lab Tables (on which are a microscope, a preserved thoracic sac, an EDP (in which are a Chapter 1 and a Chapter 2) and a laser scalpel) and a bathroom door here.

I remember Russeau saying something about the first layer&apos;s inhabitants being a sort of translating explorative species based on his findings, and he sounded excited to search the seond level for more glyphs from their discoveries.

This is the male sleeping quarters for this expidition. The walls are covered in movie posters and there are odds and ends, dishes and cups strewn everywhere. Somewhere in this dump there are records of the history-altering discoveries this expidition has made. To the southeast is the common room.

You can see an Alarm Clock and a Wardrobe (closed) here.

Home sweet home for the rest of the expedition. There is a small kitchen area in the corner. All kinds of lab equipment is strewn across the lab tables in the middle of the room, scientific research abandoned each morning to persue scientific FIELD research. You are not a scientist and do not understand what the other members of the expidition are doing when they peer at the artefacts they&apos;ve uncovered and make sounds like &apos;hmm&apos; and &apos;fascinating&apos;.
 To the north is the bathroom. The male bedrooms are to the northwest, and the female bedrooms are to the southwest. The door to the east leads outside.

Outside the Base
Kind of nippy out here. That is to say, the frigid winds of the surface feel like they&apos;re slicing you through to the bone and you are eternally humbled by the vast empty expanse of the surface, which makes you feel very small, and very insignificant, and very cold, but you hate to be melodramatic. To the north, you can see the covered area that houses the snowmobiles.

You are in the artifact room, so called because it appears to be the remains of a city that seems to have faltered in its development during a medieval period. Among the stony alien ruins lie a plethora of ancient artifacts and tools . There is a supply crate in the room, The specimen room is to the west and the ledge room is to the east.

You can see Supply crate (empty) here.

Here the ice falters, cascading downward in what may once have been a waterfall in a cup-shaped canyon east of the City Ruins. Beyond and above a series of ledges there is a wall of glyphs that Russeau has been translating.  There is a series of three ledges that crawl across the lip of the round canyon to the Glyph Wall. The artifact room is back to the west.

You can see Ledge and Broken Ladder here.

To the north, across the bottomless pit, you see another ledge. A third appears to be above it. The pit is, of course, not literally bottomless. That would be nonsense. It is, in actuality, merely a very deep pit. Certainly deep enough to send your frail mortal frame to a horribly unpleasant demise. Better be careful, hmm?

You can see Ledge here.
